### Summary:

  This app showcases a list of cuisines retrieved from a remote API, along with detailed views for each cuisine, including relevant images and additional information.
  
  The main features include:
  
  	•	A scrollable list of cuisines with names and thumbnail images.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

    1. API Integration and Error Handling:
    	  •	Ensuring seamless data fetching from a remote API.
    	  •	Added error handling with alerts to notify users of issues like network failures or malformed data.
    2. Image Caching Optimization:
    	  •	Implemented an image caching mechanism to improve performance and reduce unnecessary network calls.
    3. User Interface:
    	  •	Focused on clean, intuitive UI/UX design using SwiftUI.
  
    These areas ensure a smooth user experience, efficient performance, and a visually appealing app while handling real-world data reliability issues.


### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

    Total Time Spent 12-15 hours:
      	1. API Integration and Parsing: ~3 hours
      	2. Image Caching Implementation: ~4 hours
      	3. UI Design and Layout with SwiftUI: ~2-3 hours
      	4. Testing and Debugging: ~2 hours
      	5. README Preparation and Submission: ~1 hour


### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

    1. Due to time constraints, I focused on building a clean and functional interface rather than investing heavily in advanced UI design or custom animations. 
    2. Instead of implementing a fully custom image downloading and caching mechanism, I leveraged SwiftUI’s AsyncImage with enhancements like caching.

    
### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

    I believe the weakest part of this project is the limited customization in the UI. While the app functions efficiently and presents data clearly,the design could benefit from additional styling and animations to enhance the user experience further.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

    If given more time, I would focus on improving the UI, adding testing coverage, and handling edge cases like incomplete or invalid data more gracefully.
